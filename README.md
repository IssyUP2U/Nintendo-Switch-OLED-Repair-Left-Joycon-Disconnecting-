# Nintendo Switch OLED Repair Left Joycon Disconnecting
Issue: While physically connected to the Switch, the left joycon repeatedly disconnects. Pushing the joycon down may reconnect it, but sometimes it must be fully slid out then put back in again.

## Troubleshooting
### Question: Is the joycon the issue, or the body of the switch?
To find the cause of the issue, I swapped joycons with someone else and we both used our Switches in handheld mode. Mine continued to disconnect while the other Switch worked perfectly fine.
### Answer: The body of the Switch is the issue.
