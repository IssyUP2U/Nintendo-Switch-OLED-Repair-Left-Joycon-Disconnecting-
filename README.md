# Nintendo Switch OLED Repair Left Joycon Disconnecting
Issue: While physically connected to the Switch, the left joycon repeatedly disconnects. Pushing the joycon down may reconnect it, but sometimes it must be fully slid out then put back in again.

## Troubleshooting
### Question: Is the joycon the issue, or the body of the switch?
To find the cause of the issue, I swapped joycons with someone else and we both used our Switches in handheld mode. Mine continued to disconnect while the other Switch worked perfectly fine.
### Answer: The body of the Switch is the issue.

## Solution 1: Cleaning
I cleaned the contacts on the joycon railing with rubbing alcohol and canned air. This did not cause any notable improvement.
### Result: Failure
## Solution 2: Adjusting ribbon cable
By dismantling the body of the Switch I was able to access the ribbon cable connecting the railing to the motherboard. I removed the ribbon cable from the clasp holding it and cleaned the contacts with rubbing alcohol, then put the ribbon cable back in the clasp. I made sure the ribbon cable was secured properly then reassembled the Switch. This temporarily improved the issue, but did not fix it.
### Result: Failure
## Solution 3: Replacement
My current attempt to fix this issue will be by replacing the left-side railing on the body of the switch. It is possible the component has broken down from wear. Mayhaps I will fix the speaker fabric too.....
